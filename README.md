# Enigma-Machine

Everybody knows Enigma Machine, the powerful German cryptographic machine during the WW2.
This simulator is an exact representation of the real machine with GUI .


# Development

The Enigma Simulator was built using Java 9, so you have to update you JRE for run the Enigma.jar.
The GUI was built using Java-Fx.


# Components of Enigma Machine Simulator

- 3 drop down menu that represent the different positions on the machine ( Left, Middle, Right ) where you can choose the I , II , III. 		The roman numbers are the 3 differents rotors, each rotors is different from another because every letter is linked to another in 3 			different ways depending on Rotor.

	ES: in Rotor 3 ( encrypt ) the letter A is linked to letter Q, in Rotor 2 ( encrypt ) letter A is linked to letter G.
- 4 drop down menu that rappresent the Reflector, Left-Rotor, Middle-Rotor and Right-Rotor. In every position you can choose 1 from the 27	letters of the alphabet ( in the real machine you can rotate the rotors manually to select the starting letter )

- 27 circles each with a letter, the circle that will become yellow, represent the encrypted / decrypted letter

- 27 buttons each with a letter, when you click on one button that letter will be encrypted / decrypted and will light up the 							corresponding circle above
